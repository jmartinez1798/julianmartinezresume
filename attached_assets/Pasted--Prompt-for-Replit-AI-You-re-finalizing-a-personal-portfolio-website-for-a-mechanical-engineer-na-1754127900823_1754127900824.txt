// Prompt for Replit AI

You’re finalizing a personal portfolio website for a mechanical engineer named Julián Martínez. Please implement the following final improvements to the UI and interaction behavior of the homepage:

---

### 1. Remove Obsolete AI Assistant Elements:
- Completely remove the **purple circular button** at the bottom-right of the screen (previous AI Assistant trigger).
- Remove the floating **popup** that says "This is an AI Agent..." or similar. These elements are now deprecated and should no longer appear or load.

---

### 2. Functional SearchBar as AI Assistant Trigger:
- The large `SearchBar` at the top should now serve as the **main AI Assistant interface**.
- When the user **clicks or focuses** on the SearchBar, it should:
  - Open a **chat-like assistant modal** or container
  - Show several predefined sample questions (e.g.):
    - “What are Julian’s technical strengths?”
    - “Can I see his résumé?”
    - “What kind of projects has Julian worked on?”
    - “Tell me about Julian’s background in engineering.”
  - Animate these questions as selectable suggestions OR rotate them one by one in a typewriter-style effect inside the search input.
- Ideally, make the assistant window appear right below the input (floating card style), and **keep the UX minimal and professional**.

---

### 3. Visual Redesign of the SearchBar:
- Reduce the overall size of the SearchBar slightly so it feels more **refined and balanced**.
- Remove the robot icon on the left if it still exists.
- Add a **subtle glowing shadow animation** that pulses once every few seconds (glow in → glow out).
  - Use a `box-shadow` animation or Tailwind’s `animate-pulse` with custom timing.
  - Do **not** use bright colors — keep it neutral (light gray glow or soft blue-white).
- Keep font clean and readable (no emojis, modern font like `Inter`, medium weight).

---

### 4. Cleanup:
- Remove the subtitle under the SearchBar that says:  
  `AI Assistant • Ask anything about Julian's background, skills, or projects`  
  It’s redundant now that the assistant interaction speaks for itself.
- Ensure **responsiveness across devices**:  
  - On mobile: stack the assistant modal below input and reduce SearchBar width appropriately.

---

### Optional bonus:
- Add a little icon or `↵` inside the SearchBar as a **visual cue** that hitting "Enter" sends the question to the assistant.

---

Make this AI Assistant feel like a **recruiter-focused interface** that’s unique, elegant, and exclusive to this portfolio. Think: polished startup tech style, not experimental UI.
