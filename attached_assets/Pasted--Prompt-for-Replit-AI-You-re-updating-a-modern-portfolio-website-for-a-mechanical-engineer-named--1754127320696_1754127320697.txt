// Prompt for Replit AI

You're updating a modern portfolio website for a mechanical engineer named Julián Martínez. Please implement the following changes and enhancements to the homepage UI:

---

1. **Remove Skill Blocks:**
   - Completely remove the icon cards titled: “Simulation”, “Programming”, “Prototyping”, “Tech Tools”, and “Soft Skills.”
   - These cards should not appear in the hero section anymore.

---

2. **Search Bar Redesign (AI Assistant Prompt Simulation):**
   - Replace the removed skill cards with a **large central Search Bar** that will serve as an interactive AI assistant entry point.
   - The Search Bar should:
     - Appear prominently centered.
     - Have a modern and slightly glowing/animated border.
     - Animate example prompts using a **typing effect** that loops through phrases such as:
       - “Ask about Julian’s background”
       - “What are his main technical skills?”
       - “Do you want to download his resume?”
       - “What projects has Julian worked on?”
       - “Ask about Julian”
     - Animate one phrase at a time, simulating a real typing experience, then loop to the next.
     - Display a blinking typing cursor `|` at the end of each phrase while animating.

---

3. **Interaction Styling:**
   - On hover, the search bar should slightly expand or glow.
   - On focus (click), allow the user to type freely if desired — similar to a chatbot prompt field.

---

4. **Visual Emphasis:**
   - This AI-like Search Bar should now become the **main highlight** of the hero section.
   - Space everything to draw attention to the input bar. You may use layout tricks such as:
     - Slightly dimming or fading the background behind the SearchBar.
     - Making the bar slightly larger on desktop (e.g., width: 75% or max-w-3xl).
     - Adding subtle motion to the border or placeholder text.

---

5. **Language & Tone:**
   - Ensure all labels, animations, and placeholder text are in English.
   - Do not use emojis or cartoon-like visuals — keep it modern, elegant, and recruiter-friendly.

---

This interaction simulates an AI Assistant capable of answering any recruiter’s question about Julian’s profile. The bar is not functional yet but should **look** intelligent and interactive.

---

Bonus (optional):
- If possible, allow the prompt bar to toggle light/dark theme via the existing icon in the navbar.
